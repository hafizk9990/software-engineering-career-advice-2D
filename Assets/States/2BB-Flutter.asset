    For becoming
    a Flutter developer, you need to know Dart, Flutter and asynchronous, event-driven
    programming. Also, do learn at least one NoSQL database, like Firebase. Google''s
    official Flutter docs is the best place to get started with Flutter


    Congratulations!
    You can now be a Flutter (truly) cross-platform developer
