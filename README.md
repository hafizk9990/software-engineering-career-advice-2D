## Software Engineering Career Advice
"Software Engineering Career Advice" is my first-ever C# and Unity game. It is a 2D game, which I built after learning very humble and novel basics of Unity game engine and C# scripting language

## Features & Use Cases
* The game emulates a "console" experience, but the GUI is much more soothing on the eyes than the simple "black screen" of the console
* At each state of the game, we present you with two options. Your task is to choose from the given options based on your interests 
* After a series of questions, we let you know what career is the best for you
* We also let you know the pre-requisites of that career, so that you can go all prepared for your interview

## Development Timeline
It took me around a week to learn the basics of C# and Unity. Afterwards, I developed this game in two days. At the time of writing, I am a fnal-year student at college (2021)

## Game Complexity
As mentioned before, the game is fairly simple, as it uses a very basic-level knowledge of Unity and C#. Here, my main focus was not to build something complex, rather the main goal was to get started with Unity and C# for game development

## Implementation Details
The game uses the following components of C# and Unity to create a "game-like" experience
* Unity main camera
* Custom Unity game objects (inclucing the canvas)
* Unity 2D shapes
* Unity state maintenance
* Custom Unity fonts
* C# custom asset menu for state layout management
* C# Start() and Update() methods
* C# custom helper methods for state maintenance
